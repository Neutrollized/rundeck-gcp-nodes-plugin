# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.9-1] - 2018-12-30
### Changed
- updated `gradle` to `4.10.3`
- updated `axion-release plugin` to `1.10.0`
- updated `rundeck-core` to `3.0.9-20181127`

## [2.7.1-1] - 2018-12-17
### Added
- Adds a GCP project Id to the configuration filename which allows the user to add additional `GCP GCE Resources` as Node Sources to see the inventory of multiple projects.  Thanks to [ogerbron](https://github.com/ogerbron) for this [PR](https://github.com/Neutrollized/rundeck-gcp-nodes-plugin/pull/2)!
### Changed
- Versioning update!  The version number will correspond to the rundeck-core I'm using to build the release.  This way, users can download the latest-and-greatest plugin version to match their Rundeck version.  However, this will be the last release built with a rundeck-core of v2.x (except for bug fixes); future releases will be using rundeck-core of the v3.x variety.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-08-10
### Added
- External IP `natIP` for connection purposes as not everyone connects via `internalIP`.  Shoutout to [biff2005](https://github.com/biff2005) for the [PR](https://github.com/Neutrollized/rundeck-gcp-nodes-plugin/pull/1)!

## [0.2.3] - 2018-07-20
### Changed
- updated `google-api-services-compute` plugin to `v1-rev193-1.23.0`
- some null test if-statements that only return an error msg with `assert` to improve readability
- converted nested if-statements into if-statements with multiple conditions to improve readability
### Removed
- chipping away at the code complexity and improving code maintainability
- unused variables
- deleted some previously commented out code
- various `logger.info` throughout the code to reduce the noise

## [0.2.2] - 2018-07-11
### Changed
- updated `google-api-services-compute` plugin to `v1-rev190-1.23.0`
- updated `axion-release plugin` to `1.9.2`
### Added
- Code Climate badge to README.md
### Removed
- further clean up of Java code based on report from [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com) that I'm trying out to see where I can improve on in terms of code quality
- 3 unused methods in `InstanceToNodeMapper.java`: `getFilterParams()`, `getProjectId()` and `getMapping()`

## [0.2.1] - 2018-06-27
### Changed
- updated `google-api-services-compute` plugin to `v1-rev188-1.23.0`
- I used [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to try to clean up the repo but in doing so I messed up all the tagging, so I'm going to bump the minor version up to `v0.2.1` instead (couldn't get gradlew to tag the release at `v0.2.0` so I'm not going to fight it -- did I mention I'm sorta new at this?)
### Added
- `.travis.yml` + "build" badge to README.md

## [0.1.5] - 2018-06-18

### Changed
- change the default tag from a static `gce` to the `labels.environment`, `labels.osname` and `projectId`

### Added
